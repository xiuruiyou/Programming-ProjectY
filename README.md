To share the coding experience of this course
1.	The file (example: user.txt) format for storing user information such as account and password is “%s %s”.
2.	The file (example: books.txt) format for storing book information such as Id, title, authors, year and copies is “%d\n%s\n%s\n%d\n%d\n”. The title and authors of the book can includes the space and other symbol, but it is best not to have a title too long, because there will always be a long title if the display spacing is too large, for the short name of the book is not beautiful.
3.	The homepage has five functions, they are 1) Register an account, 2) Login, 3) Search for books, 4) Display all books, 5) Quit. Press 
4.	In the user page (after you login), you can borrow and return the books from the library (books.txt), and it will automatically generate a txt file associated with your user name to load and store the books borrowed.
